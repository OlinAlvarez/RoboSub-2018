# Troubleshoot Problems
- If you are obtaining issues with importing a newly created custom message within ROS, make sure the package name is different from the script being executed.
    - Example: 
        - Package name: computer_vision
        - Ros Node: computer_vision.py

        - Results in an error where computer_vision does not contain msg attribute.

## Adding python package
Add setup.py(ensure that you add dependent packages), uncomment catkin_python_setup(), and add __init__.py to root of package
